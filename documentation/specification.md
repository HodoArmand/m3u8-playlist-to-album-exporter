# M3U8 Playlist to Album Exporter project specification

## Goal of the program

The goal of this program is to take a .m3u8 playlist and export all tracks as a new album.

- Ask the user for an album name.
- Copy all files in it into a new directory. Derive directory name from the given album name.
- Keep playlist order, assign the .m3u8 track order to the files in the new folder as metadata.
- Assign a user given album name to all tracks.

This will make own mixtape album copies over devices (for example PC to SD card to play in your car).
